	// Create a private constructor 
	// Create a public static getinstance() that ha return type of object of singleton class - Lazy initialization

	//Abstraction
	//Hiding the implementing logic , does not have body 
	//abstract class can have abstract method and non abstract method
	// cannot create object of abstract class
	
    //Interface 
	//Only abstract method
	//no method body
	//only method declaration 
	//car class implement the BMW class method and Method override it
	//cannot create object of abstract class
	
	//Method overloading having same method name with different parameters
	//Main method can be overloaded different parameter
	//Cant override static method but can over load - method hiding
	
	//Strings are immutable and final
	
	// Encapsulation if it is declared a private it cant be accessed in the class which extends it 
	// Can be accessed in own class and Hiding data implementation.
	//Make the data variable private and methos as pubic to achieve Encapsulation
	
	//Headleass - chrome option class can be passed to webdriver
